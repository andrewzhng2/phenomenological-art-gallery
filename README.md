Stack: Svelte, FastAPI, Postgres

The Phenomenological Art Gallery is a place built for art-lovers to upload images of paintings they’ve encountered, and the app identifies the work (artist, title, year, medium, location) to generate a museum-style “plaque” and frame—treating the photo as both documentation and a fresh aesthetic object. The result is a personal gallery that captures not just what you saw, but how you encountered it. (Also allowing you to flex your artsy-romanticism side of your life)

This is a full-stack web app I wanted to build to showcase my interest in physical paintings and also learn the Svelte framework. The idea is inspired by phenomenology—the philosophy of lived experience and perception. It asks: if you photograph a painting, are you still experiencing “the painting,” or a new artwork altogether? Is a picture of a painting still a painting?
